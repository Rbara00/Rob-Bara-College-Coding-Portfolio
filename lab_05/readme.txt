This lab introduces a *doubly-linked-list*, which has pointers in both
directions: next and prev (previous)

I have written most of the linked list. You have two jobs.

[1] comment every line of the "insert" function. Your goal is to convince
me you understand how it works

[2] write (and comment) the print_nth_element_from_back() function.
The instructions for how it should work are in the code.

Let me know if you have questions.
