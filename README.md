# Rob-Bara-College-Portfolio
A work in Progress College Portfolio of Rob L. Bara. This portfolio demonstrates a variety of lab reports I have created over the course of my college degree, most of which are unedited from the time of submission, so you can understand the mistakes I made as a student, and witness the growth from my mistakes I demonstrate through later labs.
Currently consisting of:

-Introduction to C programming Labs 

-Introduction to Java Labs

-Digital Circuit Design Lab reports (Verilog)

-Processors Systems Lab reports (Assembly and C)

-Embedded Systems Design Lab reports using Vivado and SDK (C, FreeRTOS, Vivado/Verilog)

-A MATLAB Hangman final project from Engineering Analysis

-Two Analogue Electric Circuits Final Projects with the help of MATLAB and Multisim

-Micro Electronics I Analogue lab reports and final project report using MATLAB and Multisim

-Signals and Systems:Continuous & Discrete-Computer Assignments written in MATLAB

-Stochastic Processes in Signals and Systems Projects as well as a PDF to CDF converter I made

-Digital Communications Lab reports (MATLAB)

-Advanced Processors: Two MIPs Assembly projects and a 32Bit MIPs Single Cycle Processor written in VerilogHDL using Vivado 2019.1 

-Engineering Computation II Labs and Projects (Data Structures in C++ and Python)

-Data and Computer Communication Homework and Final Project Report (Networking/Intro to Cloud Computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS) ) 

-Introduction to Power Electronics Homework and Final Simulink Project (Focuses on DC-DC Buck/Boost Converters)

-For Technical Communication/Writing skills, my Final paper for Technical Communications is avaliable for viewing, which discusses creating a fast-stable real time object  detection system for Drones/UAVs. Additionally, the first set of documentation for my Senior Design Project includes a group report discussing the background for a modified Plantar test for Felines to test developments in Spinal Cord Injury models.

-Please request to view my work within Dr Bai's research lab, as it was a government project

-Python Code for My Senior Design Project can be found here:https://github.com/Rbara00/ThermalLaserSD
 Final Senior Design paper and presentation will be uplaoded upon completion of Senior Design II in Fall2022
