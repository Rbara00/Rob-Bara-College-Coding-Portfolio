The goal of this lab is to analyze a binary tree and count how many nodes have zero, one, or two
valid children. Use the attached code as template. You should only edit the "count()" function.

I've used Python in an effort to simplify things a bit for you.

Run your code from the commandline using:
python lab_06.py 0
or
python lab_06.py 1
or
python lab_06.py 2
