This folder contains two student files (student.h and student.cpp) and a main file (lab_01.cpp).
The two student files form a class. The class holds the name of a student and their test scores.
It should computes the average of those test scores and display them to the user. The lab_01
file calls the student class to test it in different ways. There are four test conditions that
you need to make work. Your goal is to complete all the missing code so that once its all compiled
and debugged, you can go to the commandline and type: "./lab_01 0" in order to run testcase 0, and
so on for cases 1, 2, and 3. Note that for case 3, you actually have to write some of the code
for the testcase yourself.

You must also write a Makefile in order to simplify how the code is compiled.

In summary do all of the following:

[1] write the makefile
[2] read BUT DO NOT EDIT student.h
[3] write all the code that needs to go in student.cpp
[4] complete the missing code for testcase_3 in lab_01.main
[5] make sure all four test cases work

Your code must compile and run. You must also comment the code adequately. Every function must be
preceded by a brief explanation, and addtional comments should be placed in the code to make
it more readable.

As always, submit the code with ./submit.py when you are ready

Let me know if you have any problems.
