In this lab you will be sorting an array of ten students, where each student is a struct that combines
a student ID and a name.

Your code should sort the array by either ID or by name. You are welcome to do this any way you like that doesn't
change any of the code I've already written.

You might choose to write two different sort functions, one for ID and one for name. That'll get you full credit
(provided you do it properly).

A more elegant solution might be to have a single sort function; the sort_by_id() and sort_by_name() functions would
then call that sort function somehow.

There are many ways to solve this and you can easily do cut-and-paste using any of the sort methods we've discussed
so far. You don't have to worry about efficiency.

Good luck.
